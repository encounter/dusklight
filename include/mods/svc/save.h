/*
 * Per-save-slot mod data.
 *
 * Named binary blobs that travel with a save slot: stored in a host-owned sidecar next to the
 * emulated memory card, written when the game writes the card (in-game save, autosave), and
 * following file-select copy and erase. Blobs are namespaced per mod — two mods can use the
 * same name without collision. Format versioning inside a blob is the mod's own concern.
 *
 * Blob calls target the *current* slot, which exists from save load / new-save creation until
 * the player returns to file select; MOD_UNAVAILABLE otherwise. Data written between game
 * saves lives in memory only — like vanilla save state, it persists when the player saves.
 * A new save clears the slot's previous blob data before on_new_save fires.
 *
 * Staleness: the sidecar snapshots a checksum of each slot's vanilla save data at write time
 * and warns at load when they diverge (e.g. the card file was replaced externally); blobs are
 * still delivered — treat them with suspicion in that session.
 *
 * Callbacks run on the game thread. Registrations are owned by the calling mod and removed
 * automatically when it is disabled, reloaded, or fails.
